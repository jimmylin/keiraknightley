Simple yes/no game where you determine if the picture presented is that of Keira Knightley.. trolololol

I have a friend who has a really hard time recognizing famous actors and actresses.  This led to us trolling him about whether a girl was Keira Knightley or not.  Built with MeteorJS, the app requires an actresses collection that I scraped from IMDB using Kimono Labs.  I will update the project later to bootstrap this data, but for now you just need an actress object with a name, img.src, and url.
